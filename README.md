# RebusNoDispatchHandlerTest
Contains test cases that simulate a minimal pipeline (on Core 2.2+ using MS DI) and trying to recreate a `MessageCouldNotBeDispatchedToAnyHandlersException` exception.  See Rebus [issue](https://github.com/rebus-org/Rebus/issues/770).  The `DispatchIncomingMessageStep` step supplied by the default pipeline is the only place that particular exception is thrown.  There is a counter on the number of handlers incremented after every handler invocation.  The list of handles (`HandlerInvokers`) in pulled from the incoming step context (i.e. just a bag keyed by type).  The handlers are defined in the `ActivateHandlersStep` step based on the message type.  So everything is keyed off types caching information in Concurrent Dictionaries which are thread safe (except for the GetOrAdd functions however these functions look pretty idempotent even those they might be run multiple times).
